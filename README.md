# pMAX Themer

## Abstract

PMAX is a big-bet for Google Ads. There are numerous initiatives on how to migrate or/and deprecate 
existing technologies in favor of PMAX. But even without deprecation/migration PMAX is a must have 
for advertisers. It can work along with search campaigns.

A PMAX campaign targets Display, YouTube, Search. Without a proper setup for Search the campaign 
will focus on Display and YouTube only. To make the campaign expand to Search an advertiser should 
enter search themes. Usually a PMAX campaign has only one Asset Group which can host 25 search themes.
Search theme is like keyword in Search but with broad match. So to allow PMAX reach its full potential 
advertisers should enter relevant search themes for their PMAX campaigns in a similar way 
they did it for their Search campaigns. But they might be reluctant to do that as they don't realize the value.

The idea behind this solution is to automate migration keywords from Search campaigns to 
PMAX campaigns with least efforts for the advertisers.
